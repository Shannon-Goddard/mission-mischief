  // Instant submission without URL requirement
  // Optional URL field for dispute protection
  // Immediate leaderboard update
}
```

#### 2. Beer Justice System
```javascript
// Enhanced bounty hunter with beer stakes
function reportCheater(url, accuser, accused) {
  // 3 beer penalty for false accusations ($15)
  // 1 beer penalty for guilty verdicts ($5)
  // 6-hour community voting period
}
```

#### 3. Weekly Research Scraping
```python
# Modified scraper for proof-of-concept validation
def weekly_research_scrape():
  # Sunday "Bounty Hunter Sunday" scraping
  # Compare user submissions vs scraped data
  # Generate research accuracy reports
```
