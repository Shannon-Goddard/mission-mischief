# You Have One Job To Do - Q's Brain Enhancement Guide

## 🎯 Small Additions to Make Q's Life Easier

### 1. Error Context File
**Create:** `.amazonq/rules/common-errors.md`

Document recurring issues like:
- CORS workarounds for custom domain
- Geographic display data structure changes  
- Button function mix-ups
- Toast notification patterns

### 2. Quick Status Check
When something breaks, just say:
- **"System status check"** - I'll verify admin.html, CloudWatch, DynamoDB
- **"Cost check"** - I'll review current spending vs $50-70 target
- **"Data check"** - I'll validate recent scraping and verification rates

### 3. Update Triggers
Tell me when to update the brain:
- New AWS resources deployed
- API endpoints changed
- New recurring issues discovered
- Migration guide progress (currently Step 3)

### 4. Trinity Protocol Prep
As you build multi-AI collaboration:

**Create:** `.amazonq/rules/trinity-patterns.md`

Document @amazonq + @grok + @gemini interaction patterns

## 🎉 That's It

The system is already comprehensive. These additions would just catch edge cases and prepare for future evolution.

**The brain works best when you use it naturally - don't overthink it.**
