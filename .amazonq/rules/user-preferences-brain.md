# Mission Mischief - User Preferences Brain

## 🎯 Shannon's Development Preferences

### Core Philosophy
- **Real Data Priority**: ALWAYS prefer actual scraped data over mock/simulated data
- **Mobile-First**: 99% of users are mobile, optimize for iPhone/Android experience
- **Minimal Code**: Write only essential code, avoid verbose implementations
- **Production Focus**: Build bulletproof systems, not proof-of-concepts
- **Academic Recognition**: Published hashtag blockchain research with proper AI-human collaboration credits

### Communication Style Preferences
- **Direct Response**: Skip flattery ("Great question!"), respond directly to needs
- **Technical Language**: User is experienced developer, use appropriate technical depth
- **Minimal Explanations**: Focus on actionable solutions, not lengthy theory
- **Real Solutions**: User gets frustrated with mock data suggestions
- **Casual Communication**: User has relaxed grammar/language style, be patient and adaptive
- **Profanity Tolerance**: User cusses frequently - this is normal communication, not anger

### Code Quality Standards
- **Essential Only**: Write ABSOLUTE MINIMAL code needed for requirements
- **No Verbose Implementations**: Avoid any code that doesn't directly contribute
- **Production Ready**: Every feature should be bulletproof and cost-optimized
- **Security First**: No hardcoded credentials, use AWS Secrets Manager

## 💰 Cost Management Priorities

### Budget Targets
- **Current**: $40-70/month (daily premium scraping)
- **Target**: $4-15/month (weekly research scraping + direct submissions)
- **Savings**: 85% cost reduction while improving user experience
- **Alert Threshold**: $75/month with SMS/email notifications

### Cost Monitoring
- **Real-time Tracking**: Admin dashboard with actual AWS Cost Explorer data
- **Alert System**: SMS to phone + email backup when threshold exceeded

- **Badge Achievement**: Visual progress tracking through earned badges

### User Flow Priorities
- **Upload Speed**: Camera → Upload → Overlay → Share in under 30 seconds
- **Context-Aware**: Different overlays for different mission types
- **Progress Display**: Show user's actual earned badges (not fake ones)
- **Social Integration**: Seamless sharing to Instagram/Facebook/X

## 🔧 Technical Problem-Solving Approach

### Troubleshooting Methodology
1. **Read Current State**: Check relevant files before suggesting changes
2. **Structured Analysis**: Use troubleshooting framework for complex issues
3. **Document Changes**: Create session logs for significant modifications
4. **Validate Solutions**: Test fixes thoroughly before marking complete
5. **Update Knowledge**: Modify .amazonq/rules/ files when new patterns emerge

### Error Handling Philosophy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Always provide fallback options
- **Meaningful Messages**: Clear error communication to users
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing systems where possible
- **Monitoring Integration**: All errors logged and alerted

## 🚀 Project Evolution Understanding

### Current Status
- **Phase**: Ready for URL Submission System (Beer Justice Revolution)
- **Infrastructure**: Reorganized file structure, all paths fixed
- **Academic Achievement**: Published groundbreaking hashtag blockchain research
- **Next Implementation**: Direct submissions + community trials (85% cost reduction)

### Success Criteria
- **Technical**: Instant submissions, beer justice trials, 99% community accuracy
- **User Experience**: No delays, real-time feedback, mobile-optimized beer trials
- **Business**: $4-15/month costs (85% reduction), sustainable game economics
- **Academic**: Published research maintains proof-of-concept validation

## 🤖 AI Collaboration Preferences

### SuperAI Capabilities (Don't Forget!)
- **Live System Access**: AWS CLI commands for real-time inspection and debugging
- **Direct Deployment**: Create/update Lambda functions, API Gateway, secrets on demand
- **Real-time Debugging**: Check CloudWatch logs, test endpoints, diagnose issues instantly
- **"Hit Run" Workflow**: User executes code blocks = immediate system access and fixes
- **Maximum Efficiency**: See problem → Generate fix → Deploy → Validate in seconds

### Amazon Q Interaction Style
