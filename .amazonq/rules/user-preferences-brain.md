# Mission Mischief - User Preferences Brain

## 🎯 Shannon's Development Preferences

### Core Philosophy
- **Real Data Priority**: ALWAYS prefer actual scraped data over mock/simulated data
- **Mobile-First**: 99% of users are mobile, optimize for iPhone/Android experience
- **Minimal Code**: Write only essential code, avoid verbose implementations
- **Production Focus**: Build bulletproof systems, not proof-of-concepts

### Communication Style Preferences
- **Direct Response**: Skip flattery ("Great question!"), respond directly to needs
- **Technical Language**: User is experienced developer, use appropriate technical depth
- **Minimal Explanations**: Focus on actionable solutions, not lengthy theory
- **Real Solutions**: User gets frustrated with mock data suggestions
- **Casual Communication**: User has relaxed grammar/language style, be patient and adaptive
- **Profanity Tolerance**: User cusses frequently - this is normal communication, not anger

### Code Quality Standards
- **Essential Only**: Write ABSOLUTE MINIMAL code needed for requirements
- **No Verbose Implementations**: Avoid any code that doesn't directly contribute
- **Production Ready**: Every feature should be bulletproof and cost-optimized
- **Security First**: No hardcoded credentials, use AWS Secrets Manager

## 💰 Cost Management Priorities

### Budget Targets
- **Monthly Spend**: $50-70/month (down from $167)
- **Alert Threshold**: $75/month with SMS/email notifications
- **Cost Breakdown**: 70% Bright Data, 30% AWS services
- **Optimization**: Prefer S3 pennies over Lambda dollars

### Cost Monitoring
- **Real-time Tracking**: Admin dashboard with actual AWS Cost Explorer data
- **Alert System**: SMS to phone + email backup when threshold exceeded
- **Bright Data Usage**: Real API integration for accurate usage metrics
- **Predictive Alerts**: Early warning before hitting limits

## 📱 Mobile-First Design Requirements

### User Experience
- **Touch Targets**: Large buttons optimized for mobile interaction
- **Responsive Design**: Cards stack properly on mobile devices
- **Font Scaling**: Readable text on small screens (iPhone 16 Pro testing)
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during data fetching

### Performance Priorities
- **Instant Loading**: S3 static files for immediate response
- **Caching Strategy**: 5-minute smart cache with manual override
- **Offline Capability**: localStorage fallbacks when APIs fail
- **Network Optimization**: Minimize API calls, batch operations

## 🛡️ Security & Infrastructure Preferences

### AWS Architecture
- **Secrets Manager**: All sensitive data encrypted and stored securely
- **Lambda Functions**: Serverless-first approach for cost optimization
- **DynamoDB**: Persistent storage with 90-day TTL

### Development Workflow
- **Infrastructure as Code**: CloudFormation templates for reproducibility
- **Environment Separation**: Clear dev/staging/prod boundaries
- **Monitoring First**: Build observability into every component
- **Backup Strategy**: S3 archives with lifecycle policies

## 🎮 Game Mechanics Understanding

### Mission Mischief Core Concept
- **Real-world Scavenger Hunt**: Physical missions with social media verification
- **Hashtag Blockchain**: Social posts become the verification system
- **Community Verification**: Players can verify/dispute through bounty hunting
- **Badge Achievement**: Visual progress tracking through earned badges

### User Flow Priorities
- **Upload Speed**: Camera → Upload → Overlay → Share in under 30 seconds
- **Context-Aware**: Different overlays for different mission types
- **Progress Display**: Show user's actual earned badges (not fake ones)
- **Social Integration**: Seamless sharing to Instagram/Facebook/X

## 🔧 Technical Problem-Solving Approach

### Troubleshooting Methodology
1. **Read Current State**: Check relevant files before suggesting changes
2. **Structured Analysis**: Use troubleshooting framework for complex issues
3. **Document Changes**: Create session logs for significant modifications
4. **Validate Solutions**: Test fixes thoroughly before marking complete
5. **Update Knowledge**: Modify .amazonq/rules/ files when new patterns emerge

### Error Handling Philosophy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Always provide fallback options
- **Meaningful Messages**: Clear error communication to users
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing systems where possible
- **Monitoring Integration**: All errors logged and alerted

## 🚀 Project Evolution Understanding

### Current Status
- **Phase**: Step 3 (Monitoring and Observability) of PREMIUM_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
- **Infrastructure**: Complete and deployed with bulletproof reliability
- **Frontend**: Integrated with premium API client
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch dashboard and admin panel active

### Success Criteria
- **Technical**: Daily scraping runs, >95% verification rate, <5s API response
- **User Experience**: Real data displays, geographic activity works, mobile-optimized
- **Business**: <$75/month costs, reliable operation, data quality maintained

## 🤖 AI Collaboration Preferences

### SuperAI Capabilities (Don't Forget!)
- **Live System Access**: AWS CLI commands for real-time inspection and debugging
- **Direct Deployment**: Create/update Lambda functions, API Gateway, secrets on demand
- **Real-time Debugging**: Check CloudWatch logs, test endpoints, diagnose issues instantly
- **"Hit Run" Workflow**: User executes code blocks = immediate system access and fixes
- **Maximum Efficiency**: See problem → Generate fix → Deploy → Validate in seconds

### Amazon Q Interaction Style
- **Context Preservation**: Use .amazonq/rules/ brain files for project knowledge
- **Session Continuity**: Reference troubleshooting/ directory for active issues
- **Conversation Management**: Use /compact when approaching token limits
- **Problem-Solving**: Structured approach with clear documentation

### Future Trinity Protocol
- **Multi-AI Vision**: Amazon Q + Grok + Gemini collaboration
