# Mission Mischief - Project Summary

## Current Status: PHASE 2 - FEATURE POLISH

### Overview
Mission Mischief is a real-world scavenger hunt game where players complete hilarious missions in public places, earn badges, and compete on leaderboards. The system uses social media hashtag scraping to track player activity and points.

### Architecture

### AWS Integration Details

#### Lambda Function (Production)
- **Endpoint**: `https://imddm6sh0i.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/scrape`
- **Runtime**: Node.js 22.x with ES module syntax (`export const handler`)
- **CORS**: Full cross-origin support with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- **APIs**: Facebook Graph API, Instagram Basic Display, X API v2
- **Schedule**: Daily scraping at 3:00 AM PST to optimize rate limits and costs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to demo data on API failures
- **Status**: Fully operational with confirmed 200 responses

#### Scraping System Architecture
- **SimpleScraper**: Lightweight scraper with AWS Lambda integration
- **Data Processing**: Leaderboard, geography, mission activity, justice cases
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic display refresh when new data arrives
- **Fallback**: Demo data when Lambda unavailable (seamless user experience)
- **Rate Limiting**: Daily schedule prevents API quota exhaustion

### Technical Specifications

#### Hashtag System (No TikTok)
```
Required: #missionmischief #realworldgame
Mission: #missionmischief[missionname]
User: #[username]
Points: #missionmischiefpoints[number]
Location: #missionmischiefcountry[country] #missionmischiefstate[state] #missionmischiefcity[city]
Evidence: #missionmischiefevidenceyourmessage
Redemption: #missionmischiefclown #missionmischiefpaidbail
```

#### Data Flow
1. User completes mission → generates hashtags
