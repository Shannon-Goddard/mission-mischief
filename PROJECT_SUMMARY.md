### AWS Integration Details

#### Lambda Function (Production)
- **Endpoint**: `https://imddm6sh0i.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/scrape`
- **Runtime**: Node.js 22.x with ES module syntax (`export const handler`)
- **CORS**: Full cross-origin support with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- **APIs**: Facebook Graph API, Instagram Basic Display, X API v2
- **Schedule**: Daily scraping at 3:00 AM PST to optimize rate limits and costs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to demo data on API failures
- **Status**: Fully operational with confirmed 200 responses

#### Scraping System Architecture
- **SimpleScraper**: Lightweight scraper with AWS Lambda integration
- **Data Processing**: Leaderboard, geography, mission activity, justice cases
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic display refresh when new data arrives
- **Fallback**: Demo data when Lambda unavailable (seamless user experience)
- **Rate Limiting**: Daily schedule prevents API quota exhaustion

### Recent Major Changes

#### TikTok Complete Removal
- ✅ Removed from bounty-hunter.html platform arrays and mock data
- ✅ Removed from admin-panel.html platform monitoring
- ✅ Removed from scraper-simple.js mission activity data
- ✅ Removed from scraper.js (API endpoints, platform scraping, parsing)
- ✅ Removed from social.js share URL generation
- ✅ Kept TikTok social icon on jointhechaos.html for brand presence
- **Reason**: TikTok API unavailable, removal prevents user confusion

- ✅ Dynamic leaderboard (shows 1-3 players based on actual users)
- ✅ Filtered geography (only shows locations with users)
- ✅ Real mission activity counts from social platforms
- ✅ Comprehensive US location data (81,363 lines)

#### Location System Enhancement
- ✅ Integrated usa-states-cities.json with complete US coverage
- ✅ Dynamic dropdown population from JSON file
- ✅ Fallback system for failed data loads
- ✅ Alphabetical city sorting
- ✅ Fetch-based loading with error handling

### Technical Specifications

#### Hashtag System (No TikTok)
```
Required: #missionmischief #realworldgame
Mission: #missionmischief[missionname]
User: #[username]
Points: #missionmischiefpoints[number]
Location: #missionmischiefcountry[country] #missionmischiefstate[state] #missionmischiefcity[city]
Evidence: #missionmischiefevidenceyourmessage
Redemption: #missionmischiefclown #missionmischiefpaidbail
```

#### Data Flow
1. User completes mission → generates hashtags
2. Posts to Instagram/Facebook/X with hashtags
3. AWS Lambda scrapes platforms daily at 3:00 AM PST
4. Data processed and stored in Lambda response
5. Bounty hunter system displays real-time results
6. Leaderboards and geography updated with actual user data

#### AWS Lambda Configuration
- **Method**: GET request to scrape endpoint
- **Response**: JSON with leaderboard, geography, missions, justice data
- **CORS Headers**: Complete cross-origin support
- **Error Handling**: 502 errors handled gracefully
- **Fallback**: Demo data maintains functionality during outages
