So, currently the geographic activity is being stored in local storage. It's a start. Need to have the post show on mission under to the respective 
mission number and next to the respective social media. Then, have it updated from the AWS setup so all players can see the information, not just local storage.

PHASE 2 AWS SYNC: FIXED! ✅
---

🎉 **SUCCESS**: AWS endpoints working perfectly!

**✅ WORKING ENDPOINTS:**
- GET /prod/submissions: Returns real DynamoDB data
- POST /prod/admin: Accepts direct submissions
- Mission activity tracking: M1 shows "X: 1"
- Geographic data: Players with social URLs
- Top players leaderboard: Real points tracking

**🔧 FIXES APPLIED:**
1. Fixed field name mismatch: 'user' → 'username'
2. Added requests library to Lambda deployment package
3. Added POST method to admin API Gateway resource
4. Added CORS support for POST method
5. Added Lambda permissions for POST method

**📊 TEST RESULTS:**
- Manual POST submission: ✅ Success
- Submissions endpoint: ✅ Returns real data
- Mission activity: ✅ M1 shows "X: 1" 
- Geographic tracking: ✅ Players with social URLs
- Leaderboard: ✅ Shannon Goddard (0 pts)

**⚠️ REMAINING ISSUE:**
Frontend AWS sync from app.html not working - submissions stay in localStorage only.
Need to debug why DirectSubmission.submitMission() isn't calling AWS sync.

**🌍 GLOBAL MULTIPLAYER STATUS:**
Backend infrastructure: ✅ COMPLETE
Frontend integration: ⚠️ Needs debugging

Ready for frontend AWS sync debugging! 🚀
