# Mission Mischief - Session Logs

## 📋 Purpose
This directory tracks active issues, solutions attempted, and what worked across development sessions.

## 🗂️ Structure
```
session-logs/
├── [YYYYMMDD]_[session_topic]/
│   ├── 01_initial_state/
│   ├── 02_changes_made/
│   │   └── changes_log.md
│   └── 03_final_state/
└── active_issues.md
```

## 📝 Session Log Template
Each session should create a folder with:
- **Date**: YYYYMMDD format
- **Topic**: Brief description (admin-dashboard, bounty-hunter-fix, etc.)
- **Changes Log**: Detailed record of what was modified and why

## 🎯 Benefits
- **Prevents Re-solving**: Don't fix the same bug twice
- **Context Preservation**: Amazon Q can reference previous solutions
- **Knowledge Building**: Build institutional memory across sessions
- **Debugging Aid**: Track what approaches worked vs failed

## 📊 Current Active Issues
See `active_issues.md` for ongoing problems that need attention.
