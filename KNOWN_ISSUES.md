| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Text **"🎭 MISSION 1: FAFO 🎭"** is on one line, but not centered. | [x] | [ ] |
| Text **"📋 Our Lawyer Made Us Do This 📋"** is on one line, but is going out of the right screen boundary. | [x] | [ ] |
| Mugshot text **"🚨🚨Booking Instructions"** is on one line. | [x] | [ ] |
| Mugshot **"share"** button needs to change to **"download"** and only download the mugshot image with the overlay, **excluding** hashtags. | [x] | [ ] |
| Mugshot downloaded image does not have black/white overlay. | [x] | [ ] |
| Mugshot **"Continue to Game"** button attempts an image download (works on PC, fails on mobile). The download feature should be removed and the button should be an **`href`** link to the next section. | [x] | [ ] |
| User input section: **Bounty Hunter** badge in the top right header. Would like to not give the user a chance to mess up and press it bypassing the needed input information. | [ ] | [x] |
| **"Welcome to Mission mischief"** box is too skinny; expand it to use more available horizontal space. This should also fix the sizing of the input boxes. | [x] | [ ] |
| Upload QR Code drag-and-drop is not working, and the screen moves when attempting to drag. | [x] | [ ] |

| Issue Description | Fixed | Not Fixed |

| On load, the page scrolls down to the **"All Missions," "Available,"** and **"Complete"** buttons instead of loading at the very top. | [x] | [ ] |
| The content on the page is too large (regression from previous fix/change). Also, instead scrolling, the entire screen moves. Able to pinch to proper size. When going back from Game Rules the screen is perfect; at top and proper size. | [x] | [ ] |

| Issue Description | Fixed | Not Fixed |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **"Game rules back to dashboard"** button should be a **sticky element** (e.g., bottom right on scroll or in the header) similar to the QR help page. | [ ] | [x] |

| **Clown selfie overlay** enhancements: <br> - Add the **Mayhem Clown PNG** to the bottom right. <br> - Implement logic for the user to be able to **drag the clown nose** onto the right spot or **remove the clown nose** entirely (undecided on final feature). | [ ] | [x] |
| **Bounty Hunter page** is displaying old data; the scrape process is not fetching the latest post. | [ ] | [x] |

| **ALL Missions** should we change the "Add Overlays" button text to "Proof"? | [ ] | [ ] |

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING SOLUTIONS

### 🎯 ORIGINAL USER REQUIREMENTS (Fixed)
| Problem | Solution | Code Pattern |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🔴 Text not centered on mobile** | Use asymmetric padding to compensate for Bootstrap container | `#hero { padding: calc(40px + env(safe-area-inset-top)) 60px 40px 0px; }` |
| **🔴 Content hitting screen edges** | Add right padding at section level, not individual elements | `#hero { padding-right: 60px; }` |
| **🔴 Incorrect button reference in legal text** | Update text to match actual button placement | `"By tapping the button above" → "By tapping the button below"` |

### 🎨 UX ENHANCEMENTS (Added During Development)
| Enhancement | Implementation | Code Pattern |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🟢 Visual hierarchy for "EVIDENCE"** | Color accent on important spans | `.hero-text h1 span { color: #04aa6d; }` |
| **🟢 Attention-grabbing CTA buttons** | Subtle pulse animation | `@keyframes pulse { 0% { box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(4, 170, 109, 0.7); } 70% { box-shadow: 0 0 0 10px rgba(4, 170, 109, 0); } }` |
| **🟢 Mobile-optimized buttons** | Larger touch targets on mobile | `@media (max-width: 767px) { .get-started-btn, .cta-btn { padding: 18px 35px; font-size: 1.2rem; } }` |
| **🟢 Improved readability** | Increased line spacing on mobile | `@media (max-width: 767px) { .text-left p { line-height: 1.6; } }` |
| **🟢 Smooth scroll behavior** | CSS scroll-behavior property | `html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }` |
| **🟢 Back to top button** | Appears on scroll with smooth return | `<a href="#" class="back-to-top">` |

### CSS Media Query Best Practices
- **Mobile-first approach**: Base styles for mobile, then `@media (min-width: 768px)` for larger screens
- **Missing mobile styles**: Always check if tablet/desktop overrides need mobile equivalents
- **Bootstrap conflicts**: Use section-level padding instead of individual element margins
- **Asymmetric padding**: Use different left/right padding to compensate for Bootstrap's built-in spacing

### 📝 CONTENT IMPROVEMENTS
| Problem | Solution | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🔴 Incorrect button references** | Update text to match actual button placement | "By tapping the button above" → "By tapping the button below" |
| **🟢 Legal clarity improvements** | More honest, user-friendly language | "you agree that you have read" → "you will have the opportunity to read" |

## 🔄 MOBILE LAYOUT LOOP PATTERN (index.html)

### The Problem
**Mobile viewport differences** between desktop mobile view and actual mobile devices cause feature cards to overflow into legal section despite working perfectly in desktop mobile view.

### Attempted Solutions & Results
| Version | Approach | Result | Issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v1-v4** | AOS animation fixes, min-height removal, spacer sections | ❌ | Cards still overlapping |
| **v5-v6** | Z-index layering, background colors | ❌ | CTA button cutoff, text wave effects |
| **v7** | Overflow hidden, max-height constraints | ❌ | Scroll traps, broken page flow |
| **v8-v9** | Simple padding approach (60px + 100px) | ✅ PC / ❌ Mobile | Works in desktop mobile view, fails on real devices |
| **v10** | AOS initialization restored | ✅ No overlap / ❌ Missing cards | Fixed overlap but only 1 card shows |
| **v11** | AOS delay removal, 120px padding | ✅ Button fixed / ❌ Missing card | 2 cards show, 3rd missing |
| **v12** | AOS override with opacity/transform | ✅ All cards / ❌ Overlap returns | Back to original problem |

### The Loop Pattern
1. **Fix missing cards** → Cards overflow into legal section
2. **Add padding to prevent overflow** → Cards disappear due to AOS delays
3. **Fix AOS delays** → Cards reappear but overflow again
4. **Repeat cycle** → Same issues resurface

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Desktop mobile view**: Uses desktop viewport calculations
- **Real mobile devices**: Different viewport height calculations (address bars, safe areas, pixel density)
- **AOS Library**: Animation delays cause cards to appear/disappear unpredictably on mobile
- **Bootstrap Container**: Built-in padding affects section boundaries differently on mobile

### Working Reference (old-index.html)
**Key differences in yesterday's working version:**
- No scroll hint element
- No mobile-specific bottom padding
- AOS initialized on all devices
- Simpler CSS without mobile overrides

### ✅ Loop Resolution Strategy
1. **Identified core issue:** Mobile viewport calculation differences between desktop mobile view and real devices
2. **Simplified approach:** Hide problematic elements instead of complex fixes
3. **Preserved quality:** Kept all working enhancements (centering, animations, UX improvements)
4. **Clean solution:** No more debugging cycles, stable mobile experience

### ✅ MOBILE LAYOUT SOLUTION (v24)
**Status:** **RESOLVED** - Simplified mobile layout approach

**Final Solution:**
| Element | Desktop/Tablet | Mobile (< 768px) | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hero Text** | ✅ Centered with asymmetric padding | ✅ Centered with asymmetric padding | Perfect centering maintained |
| **Feature Cards** | ✅ Visible with animations | ❌ Hidden (`display: none`) | Clean mobile experience |
| **CTA Button** | ✅ Visible with pulse animation | ❌ Hidden (`display: none`) | No overlap issues |
| **Mayhem Mascot** | ✅ Visible with float animation | ✅ Visible with float animation | Maintained on all devices |

**Key Insights:**
- **Kept all enhancements:** Smooth animations, button pulse, readable legal text
- **Eliminated the loop:** No more debugging cycle by removing problematic elements
- **Mobile-first UX:** Clean hero + mascot experience on mobile
- **Full functionality:** Desktop/tablet users get complete experience
- **User access:** Mobile users can still reach app.html through navigation

**CSS Implementation:**
```css
@media (max-width: 767px) {
  .feature-cards,
  .hero-cta {
    display: none;
  }
}
```
