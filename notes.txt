Mission Mischief notes:



https://missionmischief.online 

onload “YOU FOUND THE EVIDENCE
Welcome to Mission Mischief: The World's Most Sociopathic Scavenger Hunt” is aligned left partly going off screen. Needs to be centered.
The rest is great

“🎭 MISSION 1: FAFO 🎭
F*** Around and Find Out Welcome to the most legally binding comedy show on Earth!” Seems too bulky. Would like to see if “🎭 MISSION 1: FAFO 🎭” as 1 line instead of two would help the visual.

🎮 THE GAME BASICS: section’s bullet points are causing each bullet points text to have too much padding.
After thoughts: Would be nice to have section titles be one line. Love the font and color and emojis. Maybe smaller; test.
after box is checked, need obvious cue to scroll down to take mugshot button. Either page auto scrolls down or an arrow down appears.


Mugshot

remove text: Hold sign with date/time
“Booking Instructions” on separate line which is okay. Just need to move siren emoji to the other side of the word “Booking” so it looks centered.
Mugshot share button shares website address, should be mugshot image.
Mugshot does not download to device photos when continue with game button is pressed. Does on pc. Mobile looks like the page is just too fast to move on.


Form page

The box all the input and dropdowns are in is too skinny. A lot of room on each side (it’s centered) to expand.

The dashboard

on load it is too wide. Able to pinch down, but shouldn’t have to.
How to play buttons back to game (both top and bottom) takes you to index not dashboard.
Honor score deduction when found cheating.
Looks like all missions are setup to share the web address, not the missions pic or video 
Need to go over business card setup. All information is there. Just need to setup so multiple cards are printed on a single page. 2-3 columns. Idk rows. Need to test.
Choose your destiny mission needs more detail on the 4 paths missions and proof requirements. Also, section that was removed must have been connected to the js to unlock the rest of the mission. I have all 4 marked complete and the other missions are not showing.
Clown overlay. Be able to move nose on preview or just add clown.png on bottom right 
Button says clown selfie is ready, but does nothing. Need to be able to download or share.
Beer proof upload button does nothing. Need to be able to download or share.


Bounty hunter and admin panel, not same results. Need to inspect admin panel error. Try to get real data from lambda before python scrape secondary method is made.



Double check that buy me a coffee help tells user to put their social media address as their website.
