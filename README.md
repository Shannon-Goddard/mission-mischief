## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Instant Submission System
```javascript
// Direct mission completion (no delays)
function submitMission(missionId, points, optionalURL) {
  const submission = {
    mission: missionId,
    user: getCurrentUser(),
    points: points,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    proof_url: optionalURL // For dispute protection
  };
  
  updateLeaderboard(submission);
  awardBadge(missionId);
  showSuccess(`+${points} points! 🎉`);
}
```

### Beer Justice Trials
```javascript
// Community-driven dispute resolution
function startTrial(accusedUser, evidenceURL) {
  const stakes = {
    falseAccusation: 3, // beers owed if wrong
    guiltyVerdict: 1,   // beers owed if guilty
    trialDuration: 6    // hours for voting
  };
  
  createCommunityVote(accusedUser, evidenceURL, stakes);
  deductPoints(accuser, 5); // Immediate stake
  deductPoints(accused, 5);
}
```

### Research Validation
```python
# Weekly "Bounty Hunter Sunday" scraping
def validate_submissions():
    user_data = get_weekly_submissions()
    scraped_data = scrape_social_media()
    accuracy = compare_datasets(user_data, scraped_data)
    
    generate_research_report(accuracy)
    update_academic_metrics()
